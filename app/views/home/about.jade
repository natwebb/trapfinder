    h1 Trapfinder
    h3 is a game about traps and treasure.
  p
    | Use the arrow keys to move about the dungeon. You'll see treasure chests scattered around, but traps are (of course) invisible until you step on them.
    | If you find a treasure chest, good for you! Press the
    span(class='t')= ' T '
    | key to open it. If you find a trap, you'd better hope you're lucky!
  h4 Press the correct key to disarm the trap you just stepped on.
  p
    | Press the
    span(class='g')= ' G '
    | key to disarm green traps, the
    span(class='b')= ' B '
    | key to disarm blue traps, and the
    span(class='r')= ' R '
    | key to disarm red traps.
    | Green traps are a bit more forgiving, but red traps are absolutely brutal, so you'd better hope your reflexes are on point in the lower levels of the dungeon.
    | At the northeast corner of each dungeon level, you'll find the stairs down to the next level. Press the
    span(class='s')= ' S '
    | key to take the stairs.
  h4 Deeper levels have better treasure, but more dangerous traps.
  p
    | When you're ready to leave the dungeon with the treasure you've collected, return to the stairs in the southwest corner of the level, where you started.
    | Press the
    span(class='s')= ' S '
    | key to take the stairs up. You can leave the dungeon immediately from any level. Remember:
  h4 If you're killed by a trap, you lose all your treasure and start over at level 1!
  p
    | If you're playing Trapfinder II: You Are Not Alone, the rules are a bit different. There are no stairs up or down; you and your opponent should agree what dungeon level to play on.
    | You can also choose whether to play with Torch Mode on or off. Torch Mode makes the game like the original Trapfinder: you can only see a small lit area around your character;
    | everything else is shrouded in darkness. If you're boring and you want to see the entire map (including your opponent's location) you can turn Torch Mode off, but that means
    | your foe can see you as well! Either way, there's one more major difference between Trapfinder and Trapfinder II:
  h4 Instead of regular treasure, chests are full of weapons.
  p
    | You'll find more valuable weapons in deeper dungeon levels, but a single hit from anything, from the cheapest knife to
    | the poshest magic sword, will kill you just as dead. Once you have a weapon, press the
    span(class='a')= ' A '
    | key to attack. You'll use whatever weapon you most recently grabbed, but again, as long as you can connect with your foe, he's a goner.
    | Once your opponent is killed by either a trap or your weapon, press the
    span(class='w')= ' W '
    | key to end the game. (That's
    span(class='w')= ' W '
    | for "win," by the way.) It's up to you when you want to call it-- you can keep exploring the dungeon for treasure after your opponent is dead, but if you're taken out by a trap,
    | neither of you will get any treasure!
  h4 Who's responsible for this thing?
  p
    | Trapfinder: Alone in the Dark was built by
    a(href='http://www.github.com/natwebb')= ' Nat Webb '
    | as a capstone project for the front-end development program at
    a(href='http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com')= ' Nashville Software School'
    | , taught by the inimitable
    a(href='http://www.github.com/chyld')= ' Chyld Medford'
    | . The official soundtrack of the project was the album
    a(href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land_%28album%29')= ' Holy Land '
    | by Angra. The treasure and weapon sprites are all from the incredible free fantasy RPG collections by
    a(href='http://ails.deviantart.com')= ' Henrique Lazarini'
    |. Both artists are from
    a(href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil')= ' Brazil'
    | , which says something good about what they're up to down there.
