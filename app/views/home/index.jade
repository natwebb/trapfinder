    | Beneath the earth, the dungeon is waiting for you. Perhaps it holds ancient treasure; perhaps it has some religious significance;
    | perhaps it has strategic value in the endless wars that rage across the land of New Arcentis. Or perhaps some soft-handed lord safe in
    | his castle has simply decreed that this boil on his holdings be lanced. Ultimately, it's no concern of yours--
  h4 you're a trapfinder, and you're going to get the job done.
  p
    | Welcome to Trapfinder: Alone in the Dark, a game of courage, reflexes, and a whole lot of luck.
    | You play a trapfinder, hired by those who value their lives above yours to be the vanguard of their next dungeon expedition.
    | Your job is to enter the dungeon alone, armed only with your torch and your tools, and discover and disarm any traps that might be lurking there.
    | Your reward? Any treasure you chance upon in the depths is yours to keep. That may seem generous, but don't worry-- your patrons will surely take
    | good care of any trinkets they find on your arrow-riddled corpse.

    h1 Trapfinder II
    h3 You Are Not Alone
  p
    | Did they send someone else as well? Or did some rogue just hear about the job you were working and decide to bogart your treasure?
    | No matter. Down here in the dungeon, there are no rules except kill or be killed. Maybe a trap will take this guy out, or maybe you'll do the job
    | yourself, the old-fashioned way.
  h4 Good thing there are all these ancient weapons lying around.
  p
    | Look at them, just waiting to be used on any old fool who thinks he's a better trapfinder than you. Grab one out of a treasure chest.
    | Notice how good it feels in your hand. Now get to backstabbing. Or, hey, maybe just skulk around in the shadows until he stumbles into a trap.
    | That way your hands and your conscience are clean. It's up to you-- just don't let him get all these old weapons before you do. They're probably worth something...
